            For the last four decades David Sheils and Tim Godwin have been
            writing and performing music worldwide. When they both ended up
            making San Diego their home it seemed only right to put together
            something very special.

            Never Die Young was born from two musicians great respect for one
            another and their longing to continue to perform in venues across
            the US. Having been influenced by the legendary style of James
            Taylor it made even more sense to create a project that paid
            ultimate respect to his music. Never Die Young will take you down
            that Country Road James Taylor wrote about so many years ago and
            into his living room with songs like the Secret of Life. A truly
            heartfelt and authentic interpretation of the music of James Taylor.
